# dotfiles

To set everything up on a fresh installation, run:

```
./setup.sh
```

This will call all the relevant setup scripts.

The result is that xmonad is set up, all dotfiles are installed,
anaconda is installed, and the git repositories listed in
repo\_names.txt are installed.

If a change is made to any dotfiles, run:

```
./install
```
